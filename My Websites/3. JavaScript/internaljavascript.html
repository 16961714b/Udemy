	<!-- The way we use JavaScript in this exercise, is not the recommended way, but it is a good starting point. -->

	<button onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Click Me!</button>


	<!-- Just like inline CSS, the inline JavaScript makes it difficult to write complex and detailed web programs. It's much better to separate out JavaScript, from the actual content of the page. We can do it with <script> tag. -->

	<script type="text/javascript">
		
		alert("Page loaded!");
		
	</script>

	<!-- The alert message "Page loaded!" will pop up while the page is being loaded. NOTICE: It is a good convention to put the script at the end of the webpage, just before the </body> tag, or in the <head> -->
